                  Designing reward functions to guide reinforcement learning (RL) agents towards desired behavior poses a significant challenge. The difficulty lies in finding the exact reward specification that elicits the desired behavior, as it often leads to sparse learning feedback for the agent. Modifying the reward specification to provide dense feedback may introduce unintended consequences and encourage undesirable behavior. While potential-based reward shaping has been proposed as a solution, we demonstrate its limitations in resolving sub-optimalities resulting from various design choices, and its potential to significantly degrade performance when used naively. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework that employs a bi-level objective for learning a ``behavior alignment reward''. This reward function combines auxiliary rewards, defined by a designer's heuristics, with primary rewards provided by the environment. By doing so, our method remains robust against heuristic misspecification and dynamically adapts the agent's policy optimization procedure, addressing other sub-optimalities introduced by algorithmic design choices. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across a range of tasks, from small-scale to high-dimensional control tasks, where we incorporate heuristics of varying quality as auxiliary rewards, some of which are beneficial and others detrimental. Our framework offers a robust approach for incorporating heuristics that surpasses the limitations of previous methods, including potential-based reward shaping.

                  Large transformer models trained on diverse datasets have shown a remarkable ability to learn in-context, achieving high few-shot performance on tasks they were not explicitly trained to solve. In this paper, we study the in-context learning capabilities of transformers in decision-making problems, i.e., reinforcement learning (RL) for bandits and Markov decision processes. To do so, we introduce and study Decision-Pretrained Transformer (DPT), a supervised pretraining method where the transformer predicts an optimal action given a query state and an in-context dataset of interactions, across a diverse set of tasks. This procedure, while simple, produces a model with several surprising capabilities. We find that the pretrained transformer can be used to solve a range of RL problems in-context, exhibiting both exploration online and conservatism offline, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. The model also generalizes beyond the pretraining distribution to new tasks and automatically adapts its decision-making strategies to unknown structure. Theoretically, we show DPT can be viewed as an efficient implementation of Bayesian posterior sampling, a provably sample-efficient RL algorithm. We further leverage this connection to provide guarantees on the regret of the in-context algorithm yielded by DPT, and prove that it can learn faster than algorithms used to generate the pretraining data. These results suggest a promising yet simple path towards instilling strong in-context decision-making abilities in transformers.

                  Representation learning and exploration are among the key challenges for any deep reinforcement learning agent. In this work, we provide a singular value decomposition based method that can be used to obtain representations that preserve the underlying transition structure in the domain. Perhaps interestingly, we show that these representations also capture the relative frequency of state visitations, thereby providing an estimate for pseudo-counts for free. To scale this decomposition method to large-scale domains, we provide an algorithm that never requires building the transition matrix, can make use of deep networks, and also permits mini-batch training. Further, we draw inspiration from predictive state representations and extend our decomposition method to partially observable environments. With experiments on multi-task settings with partially observable domains, we show that the proposed method can not only learn useful representation on DM-Lab-30 environments (that have inputs involving language instructions, pixel images, rewards, among others) but it can also be effective at hard exploration tasks in DM-Hard-8 environments.

                  We study the learning dynamics of self-predictive learning for reinforcement learning, a family of algorithms that learn representations by minimizing the prediction error of their own future latent representations.
    Despite its recent empirical success, such algorithms have an apparent defect: trivial representations (such as constants) minimize the prediction error, yet it is obviously undesirable to converge to such solutions.
    %\berna{Not only undesirable, but rarely observed in practice.}
    Our central insight is that careful designs of the optimization dynamics are critical to learning meaningful representations. We identify that a faster paced optimization of the predictor and semi-gradient updates on the representation, are crucial to preventing the representation collapse. Then in an idealized setup, we show self-predictive learning dynamics carries out spectral decomposition on the state transition matrix, effectively capturing information of the transition dynamics. Building on the theoretical insights, we propose bidirectional self-predictive learning, a novel self-predictive algorithm that learns two representations simultaneously. We examine the robustness of our theoretical insights with a number of small-scale experiments and showcase the promise of the novel representation learning algorithm with large-scale experiments.

                  Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a general-purpose technique for

Reusing old data is critical for policy evaluation, but existing estimators that reuse old data introduce large bias such that we can not obtain a valid confidence interval. Inspired from a related field called survey sampling, we introduce a variant of the doubly robust (DR) estimator, called the regression-assisted DR estimator, that can incorporate the past data without introducing a large bias. The estimator unifies several existing off-policy policy evaluation methods and improves on them with the use of auxiliary information and a regression approach. We prove that the new estimator is asymptotically unbiased, and provide a consistent variance estimator to a construct a large sample confidence interval. Finally, we empirically show that the new estimator improves estimation for the current and future policy values, and provides a tight and valid interval estimation in several nonstationary recommendation environments.

                  Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a general-purpose technique for
addressing problems involving sequential decision-making. However, most RL methods
are based upon the fundamental assumption that the transition dynamics and reward
functions are fixed, that is, the underlying Markov decision process is stationary.
This limits the applicability of such RL methods because real-world problems are
often subject to changes due to external factors (passive non-stationarity), or changes
induced by interactions with the system itself (active non-stationarity), or both
(hybrid non-stationarity). For example, personalized automated healthcare systems
and other automated human-computer interaction systems need to constantly account
for changes in human behavior and interests that occur over time. Further, when the
stakes associated with financial risks or human life are high, the cost associated with a false stationarity assumption may be unacceptable. In this work, we address several
challenges underlying (off-policy) policy evaluation, improvement, and safety amidst
such non-stationarities. Our approach merges ideas from reinforcement learning,
counterfactual reasoning, and time-series analysis.
                    
                    When the stationarity assumption is violated, using existing algorithms may result
in a performance lag and false safety guarantees. This raises the question: how can we
use historical data to optimize for future scenarios? To address this challenges in the
presence of passive non-stationarity, we show how future performance of a policy can
be evaluated using a forecast obtained by fitting a curve to counter-factual estimates
of policy performances over time, without ever directly modeling the underlying
non-stationarity. We show that this approach further enables policy improvement to
proactively search for a good future policy by leveraging a policy gradient algorithm
that maximizes a forecast of future performance. Building upon these advances, we
present a Seldonian algorithm that provides the first steps towards ensuring safety,
with high confidence, for smoothly-varying non-stationary decision problems.
                    
                    The presence of active and hybrid non-stationarity pose additional challenges by
exposing a completely new feedback loop that allows an agent to potentially control
the non-stationary aspects of the environment. This makes the outcomes of future
decisions dependent on all of the past interactions, thereby resulting in effectively a
single lifelong sequence of decisions. We propose a method that provides the first steps
towards a general procedure for on-policy and off-policy evaluation amidst structured
changes due to active, passive, or hybrid non-stationarity.

                  Methods for sequential decision-making are often built upon a foundational assumption that the underlying decision process is stationary. This limits the application of such methods because real-world problems are often subject to changes due to external factors (\textit{passive} non-stationarity), changes induced by interactions with the system itself (\textit{active} non-stationarity), or both (\textit{hybrid} non-stationarity). In this work, we take the first steps towards the fundamental challenge of on-policy and off-policy evaluation amidst structured changes due to active, passive, or hybrid non-stationarity. Towards this goal, we make a \textit{higher-order stationarity} assumption such that non-stationarity results in changes over time, but the way changes happen is fixed. We propose, OPEN, an algorithm that uses a double application of counterfactual reasoning and a novel importance-weighted instrument-variable regression to obtain both a lower bias and a lower variance estimate of the structure in the changes of a policy's past performances. Finally, we show promising results on how OPEN can be used to predict future performances for several domains inspired by real-world applications that exhibit non-stationarity.

                 While there has been extensive work on learning from offline data for contextual multi-armed bandit settings, existing methods typically assume there is no environment shift: that the learned policy will operate in the same environmental process as that of data collection. However, this assumption may overly limit the use of these methods for many practical situations where there may be distribution shifts. In this work we propose Factored Distributionally Robust Optimization (Factored-DRO), which is able to separately handle distribution shifts in the context distribution and shifts in the reward generating process. Prior work that either ignores potential shifts in the context, or considers them jointly, can lead to performance that is too conservative and does not consider context shift at all, especially under certain forms of reward feedback. Our Factored-DRO objective mitigates this by considering the shifts separately, and our proposed estimators are consistent and converge asymptotically. We also introduce a practical algorithm and demonstrate promising empirical results in environments based on real-world datasets, such as voting outcomes and scene classification.

                 We propose a first-order method for convex optimization, where instead of being restricted to the gradient from a single parameter, gradients from multiple parameters can be used during each step of gradient descent. This setup is particularly useful when a few processors are available that can be used in parallel for optimization. Our method uses gradients from multiple parameters in synergy to update these parameters together towards the optima. While doing so, it is ensured that the computational and memory complexity is of the same order as that of gradient descent. Empirical results demonstrate that even using gradients from as low as \textit{two} parameters, our method can often obtain significant acceleration and provide robustness to hyper-parameter settings. We remark that the primary goal of this work is less theoretical, and is instead aimed at exploring the understudied case of using multiple gradients during each step of optimization.

                  Coagent networks for reinforcement learning (RL) (Thomas and Barto, 2011) provide a framework for deriving principled learning rules for stochastic neural networks in the RL setting. Previous work provided generalized coagent learning rules for the asynchronous setting (Kostas et al., 2020) and for the setting in which network parameters are shared (Zini et al., 2020). This work provides a generalized theorem that can be used to obtain learning rules for the combination of those cases; that is, the case where an asynchronous coagent network uses shared parameters. This work also provides a discussion of recent, ongoing, and future work.

                  Shared autonomy refers to approaches for enabling an autonomous agent to collaborate with a human with the aim of improving human performance. However, besides improving performance, it may often also be beneficial that the agent concurrently accounts for preserving the user‚Äôs experience or satisfaction of collaboration. In order to address this additional goal, we examine approaches for improving the user experience by constraining the number of interventions by the autonomous agent. We propose two model-free reinforcement learning methods that can account for both hard and soft constraints on the number of interventions. We show that not only does our method outperform the existing baseline, but also eliminates the need to manually tune a black-box hyperparameter for controlling the level of assistance. We also provide an in-depth analysis of intervention scenarios in order to further illuminate system understanding.

                     Given a graph where every node has certain attributes associated with it and some nodes have labels associated with them, Collective Classification (CC) is the task of assigning labels to every unlabeled node using information from the node as well as its neighbors. It is often the case that a node is not only influenced by its immediate neighbors but also by higher order neighbors, multiple hops away. Recent state-of-the-art models for CC learn end-to-end differentiable variations of Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) kernels to aggregate multi-hop neighborhood information. In this work, we propose a Higher Order Propagation Framework, HOPF, which provides an iterative inference mechanism for these powerful differentiable kernels. Such a combination of classical iterative inference mechanism with recent differentiable kernels allows the framework to learn graph convolutional filters that simultaneously exploit the attribute and label information available in the neighborhood. Further, these iterative differentiable kernels can scale to larger hops beyond the memory limitations of existing differentiable kernels. We also show that existing WL kernel-based models suffer from the problem of Node Information Morphing where the information of the node is morphed or overwhelmed by the information of its neighbors when considering multiple hops. To address this, we propose a specific instantiation of HOPF, called the NIP models, which preserves the node information at every propagation step. The iterative formulation of NIP models further helps in incorporating distant hop information concisely as summaries of the inferred labels. We do an extensive evaluation across 11 datasets from different domains. We show that existing CC models do not provide consistent performance across datasets, while the proposed NIP model with iterative inference is more robust.

                   When faced with sequential decision-making problems, it is often useful to be able to predict what would happen if decisions were made using a new policy. Those predictions must often be based on data collected under some previously used decision-making rule. Many previous methods enable such off-policy (or counterfactual) estimation of the expected value of a performance measure called the return. In this paper, we take the first steps towards a universal off-policy estimator (UnO) -- one that provides off-policy estimates and high-confidence bounds for any parameter of the return distribution. We use UnO for estimating and simultaneously bounding the mean, variance, quantiles/median, inter-quantile range, CVaR, and the entire cumulative distribution of returns. Finally, we also discuss Uno's applicability in various settings, including fully observable, partially observable (i.e., with unobserved confounders), Markovian, non-Markovian, stationary, smoothly non-stationary, and discrete distribution shifts.

                   Many sequential decision making problems are high-stakes and require off-policy evaluation (OPE) of a new policy using historical data collected using some other policy. One of the most common OPE technique that provides unbiased estimates is trajectory based importance sampling (IS). However, due to the high variance of trajectory IS estimates, importance sampling methods based on stationary distributions (SIS) have recently been adopted. Unfortunately, while SIS often provides lower variance estimates, estimating the stationary distribution ratios can be challenging and lead to biased estimates. In this paper, we present a new perspective on this bias-variance trade-off and show the existence of a spectrum of estimators whose endpoints are SIS and IS, respectively. We then show that estimators in this spectrum allow us to trade-off between the bias and variance of IS and SIS and can achieve lower mean-squared error than both IS and SIS.

                   In real-world sequential decision problems, exploration is expensive, and the risk of expert decision policies must be evaluated from limited data. In this setting, Monte Carlo (MC) risk estimators are typically used to estimate the risk of decision policies. While these estimators have the desired low bias property, they often suffer from large variance. In this paper, we consider the problem of minimizing the asymptotic mean squared error and hence variance of MC risk estimators. 
We show that by carefully choosing the data sampling policy (\emph{behavior policy}), we can obtain low variance estimates of the risk of any given decision policy.

                   We present several classes of reinforcement learn-ing algorithms that safely generalize toMarkovdecision processes(MDPs) not seen during train-ing.  Specifically, we study the setting in whichsome set of MDPs is accessible for training. Forvarious definitions of safety, our algorithms giveprobabilistic guarantees that agents can safely gen-eralize to MDPs that are sampled from the samedistribution but are not necessarily in the train-ing set.   These algorithms are a type ofSeldo-nianalgorithm (Thomas et al., 2019), which is aclass of machine learning algorithms that returnmodels with probabilistic safety guarantees foruser-specified definitions of safety.

                  Shared  autonomy  refers  to  approaches  for  en-abling an autonomous agent to collaborate witha human with the aim of improving human per-formance.  However, besides improving perfor-mance, it may often be beneficial that the agentconcurrently accounts for preserving the user‚Äôsexperience or satisfaction of collaboration. In or-der to address this additional goal, we examineapproaches for improving the user experience byconstraining the number of interventions by theautonomous agent. We propose two model-freereinforcement learning methods that can accountfor both hard and soft constraints on the numberof interventions. We show that not only does ourmethod outperform the existing baseline, but alsoeliminates the need to manually tune an arbitraryhyperparameter for controlling the level of assis-tance.  We also provide an in-depth analysis ofintervention scenarios in order to further illumi-nate system understanding.

                   Many sequential decision-making systems leverage data collected using prior policies to propose a new policy. In critical applications, it is important that high-confidence guarantees on the new policy's behavior are provided before deployment, to ensure that the policy will behave as desired. Prior works have studied high-confidence off-policy estimation of the \emph{expected} return, however, high-confidence off-policy estimation of the \emph{variance} of returns can be equally critical for high-risk applications. In this paper, we tackle the previously open problem of estimating and bounding, with high confidence, the variance of returns from off-policy data.

                    Many real-world sequential decision-making problems involve critical systems that present both human-life and financial risks. While several works in the past have proposed methods that are safe for deployment, they assume that the underlying problem is stationary. However, many real-world problems of interest exhibit non-stationarity, and when stakes are high, the cost associated with a false stationarity assumption may be unacceptable. Addressing safety in the presence of non-stationarity remains an open question in the literature. We present a type of Seldonian algorithm (Thomas et al., 2019), taking the first steps towards ensuring safety, with high confidence, for smoothly varying non-stationary decision problems, through a synthesis of model-free reinforcement learning algorithms with methods from time-series analysis.

                    Most reinforcement learning methods are based upon the key assumption that the transition dynamics and reward functions are fixed, that is, the underlying Markov decision process is stationary. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption is violated, and using existing algorithms may result in a performance lag. To proactively search for a good future policy, we present a policy gradient algorithm that maximizes a forecast of future performance. This forecast is obtained by fitting a curve to the counter-factual estimates of policy performance over time, without explicitly modeling the underlying non-stationarity. The resulting algorithm amounts to a non-uniform reweighting of past data, and we observe that minimizing performance over some of the data from past episodes can be beneficial when searching for a policy that maximizes future performance. We show that our algorithm, called Prognosticator, is more robust to non-stationarity than two online adaptation techniques, on three simulated problems motivated by real-world applications.

                    Performance evaluations are critical for quantifying algorithmic advances in reinforcement learning. Recent reproducibility analyses have shown that reported performance results are often inconsistent and difficult to replicate. In this work, we argue that the inconsistency of performance stems from the use of flawed evaluation metrics. Taking a step towards ensuring that reported results are consistent, we propose a new comprehensive evaluation methodology for reinforcement learning algorithms that produces reliable measurements of performance both on a single environment and when aggregated across environments. We demonstrate this method by evaluating a broad class of reinforcement learning algorithms on standard benchmark tasks.

                    In many real-world sequential decision making problems, the number of available actions (decisions) can vary over time. While problems like catastrophic forgetting, changing transition dynamics, changing rewards functions, etc. have been well-studied in the lifelong learning literature, the setting where the action set changes remains unaddressed. In this paper, we present an algorithm that autonomously adapts to an action set whose size changes over time. To tackle this open problem, we break it into two problems that can be solved iteratively: inferring the underlying, unknown, structure in the space of actions and optimizing a policy that leverages this structure. We demonstrate the efficiency of this approach on large-scale real-world lifelong learning problems.

                   The Markov decision process (MDP) formulation used to model many real-world sequential decision making problems does not capture the setting where the set of available decisions (actions) at each time step is stochastic. Recently, the stochastic action set Markov decision process (SAS-MDP) formulation has been proposed, which captures the concept of a stochastic action set. In this paper we argue that existing RL algorithms for SAS-MDPs suffer from divergence issues, and present new algorithms for SAS-MDPs that incorporate variance reduction techniques unique to this setting, and provide conditions for their convergence. We conclude with experiments that demonstrate the practicality of our approaches using several tasks inspired by real-life use cases wherein the action set is stochastic.

                   Strategic recommendations (SR) refer to the problem where an intelligent agent observes the sequential behaviors and activities of users and decides when and how to interact with them to optimize some long-term objectives, both for the user and the business. These systems are in their infancy in the industry and in need of practical solutions to some fundamental research challenges. At Adobe research, we have been implementing such systems for various use-cases, including points of interest recommendations, tutorial recommendations, next step guidance in multi-media editing software, and ad recommendation for optimizing lifetime value. There are many research challenges when building these systems, such as modeling the sequential behavior of users, deciding when to intervene and offer recommendations without annoying the user, evaluating policies offline with high confidence, safe deployment, non-stationarity, building systems from passive data that do not contain past recommendations, resource constraint optimization in multi-user systems, scaling to large and dynamic actions spaces, and handling and incorporating human cognitive biases. In this paper we cover various use-cases and research challenges we solved to make these systems practical.

                    Most model-free reinforcement learning methods leverage state representations (embeddings) for generalization, but either ignore structure in the space of actions or assume the structure is provided a priori. We show how a policy can be decomposed into a component that acts in a low-dimensional space of action representations and a component that transforms these representations into actual actions. These representations improve generalization over large, finite action sets by allowing the agent to infer the outcomes of actions similar to actions already taken. We provide an algorithm to both learn and use action representations and provide conditions for its convergence. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated on large-scale real-world problems.

                     Semi-supervised node classification in attributed graphs, i.e., graphs with node features, involves learning to classify unlabeled nodes given a partially labeled graph. Label predictions are made by jointly modeling the node and its' neighborhood features. State-of-the-art models for node classification on such attributed graphs use differentiable recursive functions that enable aggregation and filtering of neighborhood information from multiple hops. In this work, we analyze the representation capacity of these models to regulate information from multiple hops independently. From our analysis, we conclude that these models despite being powerful, have limited representation capacity to capture multi-hop neighborhood information effectively. Further, we also propose a mathematically motivated, yet simple extension to existing graph convolutional networks (GCNs) which has improved representation capacity. We extensively evaluate the proposed model, F-GCN on eight popular datasets from different domains. F-GCN outperforms the state-of-the-art models for semi-supervised learning on six datasets while being extremely competitive on the other two.

                     Given a graph where every node has certain attributes associated with it and some nodes have labels associated with them, Collective Classification (CC) is the task of assigning labels to every unlabeled node using information from the node as well as its neighbors. It is often the case that a node is not only influenced by its immediate neighbors but also by higher order neighbors, multiple hops away. Recent state-of-the-art models for CC learn end-to-end differentiable variations of Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) kernels to aggregate multi-hop neighborhood information. In this work, we propose a Higher Order Propagation Framework, HOPF, which provides an iterative inference mechanism for these powerful differentiable kernels. Such a combination of classical iterative inference mechanism with recent differentiable kernels allows the framework to learn graph convolutional filters that simultaneously exploit the attribute and label information available in the neighborhood. Further, these iterative differentiable kernels can scale to larger hops beyond the memory limitations of existing differentiable kernels. We also show that existing WL kernel-based models suffer from the problem of Node Information Morphing where the information of the node is morphed or overwhelmed by the information of its neighbors when considering multiple hops. To address this, we propose a specific instantiation of HOPF, called the NIP models, which preserves the node information at every propagation step. The iterative formulation of NIP models further helps in incorporating distant hop information concisely as summaries of the inferred labels. We do an extensive evaluation across 11 datasets from different domains. We show that existing CC models do not provide consistent performance across datasets, while the proposed NIP model with iterative inference is more robust.

                     When crowdsourcing systems are used in combination with machine inference systems in the real world, they benefit the most when the machine system is deeply integrated with the crowd workers. However, if researchers wish to integrate the crowd with "off-the-shelf" machine classifiers, this deep integration is not always possible. This work explores two strategies to increase accuracy and decrease cost under this setting. First, we show that reordering tasks presented to the human can create a significant accuracy improvement. Further, we show that greedily choosing parameters to maximize machine accuracy is sub-optimal, and joint optimization of the combined system improves performance.
